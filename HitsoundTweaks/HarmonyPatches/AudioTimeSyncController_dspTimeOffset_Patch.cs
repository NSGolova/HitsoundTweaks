/*
 * For some reason, either the dspTime or the AudioSource time doesn't behave as it should, resulting in the _dspTimeOffset field oscillating between several discrete values
 * This causes hitsound timings to be irregular, which is audible to the player
 * To fix this, we patch out the _dspTimeOffset update, and reimplement it to follow a cumulative average of the target offset calculated each frame
 * The actual _dspTimeOffset value is set to whatever target offset we find that is closest to the average
 * Why? Because the target offset is always either exactly right, or off by a significant amount
 * The average tells us which of the encountered values should be considered the correct one
 * With this approach, sample-perfect timing is achieved reliably
